After assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of CI. Please choose ONE option for the grade: either "C" for correct answers, or "I" for incorrect answers.

For example, after reviewing a correct answer you might write 'GRADE: C' or after reviewing an incorrect answer you might write 'GRADE: I'.

First, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about the criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answers at the outset. Then, end with your answer formatted as 'GRADE: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of CI.
